A Composer-based installer for [Open Restaurant](http://open.restaurant).

## Usage

We highly recommend using Composer to install your Open Restaurant codebase.

Use the following command to create a new Open Restaurant project:

`$ composer create-project openrestaurant/openrestaurant-project myrestaurant --stability dev`

Composer will pull in the openrestaurant profile and all required dependencies. A docroot directory will be created and the Drupal code will be placed there. You can then install it like you would any other Drupal site.
